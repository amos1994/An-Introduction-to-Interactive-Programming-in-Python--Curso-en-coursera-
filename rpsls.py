# The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors

import random

def number_to_name(number):
    # fill in your code below
	if number == 0:
		return "rock"
	elif number == 1:
		return "Spock"
	elif number == 2:
		return "paper"
	elif number == 3:
		return "lizard"
	elif number == 4:
		return "scissors"
